== Introduction
The folder *model_package* contain a generic structure for a Python package, with *setup.py* and everything needed for a basic package.

=== Model Package info

.The package is designed for:
* Unit test with *pytest*
* CI with *gitlab-ci*
* readme with *asciidoc*
* Python 3 only
* logs with *logging*.
** Each Python file in the package structure must have:
+
[source, python]
----
import logging
LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)
----
+
** You must use this when printing something (error, warning, info, debug):
+
[source, python]
----
LOG.debug("Here is some info")
----
+
** At the start of your main function, you must do:
+
[source, python]
----
from . import utils
utils.init_log(log={my_package}, stdout_loglevel="INFO", file_loglevel="DEBUG")
----
+
to ensure logging properly works

* [optional] configuration file with *configobj*

== How to use

Just run the script in its directory:
[source, bash]
----
./create_new_package.py --name "toto"
----

The package will appear in a *generated* folder. Copy paste everything in it where you want to put your package (in a new Git repository for instance)

For help on the script, type:
[source, bash]
----
./create_new_package.py -h
----

[[plugin_list]]
== List of Plugins available
Plugins are available. They are extra lines of code only needed when you want a specific feature.

=== ini file: `--ini`
To include this plugin, add the option `--ini` to the command line:
[source, bash]
----
./create_new_package.py --name blabla --ini
----

If chosen, will add *<my_package>/config.py* that contain the *get_config* function.

NOTE: This function is intended for developpers and not supposed to be used outside of the package. It's main use is to have a reliable validation function that describe what's going wrong with the configuration file.

Use it like this:
[source, python]
----
from . import config

params = config.get_config('my_inifile.ini')
----

IMPORTANT: Note that the file *<my_package>/configspec.ini* contain the description for your configuration file and *MUST* be changed.

=== GUI: `--gui`
To include this plugin, add the option `--gui` to the command line:
[source, bash]
----
./create_new_package.py --name blabla --gui
----

This will create an *Application* class in *gui.py* and to launch it, you just do:
[source]
----
import {my_package}

{my_package}.run()
----

== How to make change to the model package ?
=== Main Package
Files in the *model_package* will be copied into your future package, keeping the same structure.

.Generic rules:
* Each file must end with a blanck line (mainly because of plugins, to avoid that the first line of a plugin file to be added to the last line of the original file)
* Each time the package name must be present (either for a file/folder name, or inside the file itself), a generic tag *<my_package>* must be in its place. During package creation, this tag will be replaced with the name chosen for the package.
* Each new Python file in the package must start with the following lines:
+
[source, python]
----
import logging
LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)
----
+

=== For plugins
Plugin folder must respect the same structure as the main *model_package*.
I.e. for a plugin to add lines to an existing *<my_package>/utils.py* file, you must create the same file, in the same
sub-folder, under the plugin structure, then add the extra lines you want to add.

When a file exist in both the model and the plugin, file content in the plugin will be appended in the original file.

IMPORTANT: All files must end in a blanck line. If not, when trying to append, last line of first file and first line of second file will be mixed up in the same line

For instance, here is one structure for *model_package*:
[quote]
----
model_package/
├── <my_package>
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   └── version.py
├── .gitignore
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
├── README.adoc
├── requirements.txt
└── setup.py
----

Here is the structure of the *ini_file_plugin*:
[quote]
----
ini_file_plugin/
├── <my_package>
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── configspec.ini
│   └── __init__.py
└── requirements.txt
----

.Plugin rules:
* you don't need to add in the plugin structures files that have not changed compared to the model package
* you can only add lines. You can't delete lines from the *model_package* via a plugin
* When adding to a plugin a file that already exist in *model_package*, its lines will be added at the end of the corresponding original file
